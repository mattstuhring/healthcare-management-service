/**
 * Stubs
 * Stubs are objects that return predefined values.
 * Like mocks, they donâ€™t have working implementations.
 * However, unlike mocks, they are not programmed to expect specific calls.
 * Instead, they return values when they are called.
 *
 * Example
 * A stub might be programmed to always return the same value when called with any arguments.
 * Stubs are generally used to provide data that our code needs to run. This data can be hard-coded or generated dynamically.
